 This app aims to provide an easy one click way to add and manage books of any library. The app can aid in adding books to the database (Firebase from google) by extracting text from the cover photo of the book using high end machine learning  models which is extremely lightweight even while being accurate most of the time. The search and homepage uses modern UI but preserves system resources by reusing and sharing components.
